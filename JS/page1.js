console.log(`Here is how Node.js handles a file request:
1)Sends the task to the computer's file system.
2)Ready to handle the next request.
3)When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
Node.js runs non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.`)
